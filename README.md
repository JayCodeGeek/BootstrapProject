# BootstrapProject

With the intention of learning CSS Framework inorder to design beautiful and user-friendly interface in short period i've created this project.
Things i learned while creating this project is that Bootstrap contains template, icons, components which we can include in our project by adding CDN link.
Bootstrap is a 12 column layout system, by adding pre-defined classname we can create a responsive website.
I've designed a website of restaurant which has multiple cuisines to offer to their customers within affordable prices and serves delicious food.
Took a look at project and share your thoughts.
